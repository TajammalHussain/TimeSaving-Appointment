# TimeSaving-Appointment
The system has successfully achieved all of its objectives and functional requirements. The entire functionality of the system follows a sequence of steps. Patients can successfully login, select a related doctor, and book an appointment based on available time slots. They are also able to cancel or reschedule their appointment prior to attendance. The rescheduling feature has been fully implemented.
Doctors can view booked appointments and attend to patients by updating their live status on the day of the appointment. After diagnosing a patient, doctors can prescribe medication and instructions, which will be automatically saved with the patient's record. Patients have the option to share their prescription with any future healthcare provider.
Throughout this project, I have gained valuable knowledge about the importance of literature review in developing research topics and questions. Research papers provided valuable insight into the development process. The spiral model was a useful tool for starting work even when requirements were not fully defined, making it easier to make changes with each iteration. Working with languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and technologies like Bootstrap, enhanced my skills and approach to the project.
This system has improved my understanding of similar systems and increased my knowledge of research analysis and research questions. I have applied all of my previous and current knowledge, methodologies, techniques, tools, and awareness issues gained from my master's degree modules.
